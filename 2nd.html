      <h1>Early work and breakthrough</h1>
        <p> Stalk of the Celery Monster attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions, which offered Burton an animator's 
          apprenticeship at its animation division. While at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, Vincent, a six-minute 
          black-and-white stop motion film based on a poem written by Burton, which depicts a young boy who fantasizes that he is 
          his hero Vincent Price, with Price himself providing narration. </p>
      <h2>2022–present: Wednesday and resurgence</h2>
        <p>In February 2021, it was announced that Burton would be directing and producing Wednesday, a series for Netflix based on 
          the titular character from The Addams Family starring Jenna Ortega and Christina Ricci.[50][51] This marked Burton's first 
          foray into directing television since the 1980s. He helmed four episodes in the first season, which began production in September 2021 
          for a November 2022 release.</p> <!-- User story Q10-->
